The current version is theoretically compatible with any battery-powered Windows system.

Please start any application (including the background worker) as administrator to prevent any problems in this regard.

However, the system is not designed for every scenario. Incorrect setup can render the device unbootable and potentially brick it.

Please use it with caution. I am not responsible for data loss or users who are locked out of the system.
